# CPSC 312 P1 : Dungeon Adventure

Authors: Dan Glaser, Feng-Yi Bian, James Wang

# What is the problem?

We will use haskell to implement a text based adventure/dungeon game that will allow users to navigate the world, interact with objects, gather items, and use the items to alter the experience.

By constructing the foundation of the game, it should be possible for additional worlds to be implemented while having functional controls already incorporated. Ultimately, this allows for additional level design or new fun objects to be added to the game which will alter the game entirely.

# What is the something extra?

By developing the game and controls to navigate, it should be possible to import additional levels into the “engine”. Additionally, we will look into areas with random content that will change the experience from game to game.

# What did we learn from doing this?

(This should be written after you have done the work.) What is the bottom-line? Is functional programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
